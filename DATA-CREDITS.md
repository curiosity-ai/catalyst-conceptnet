### Commonsense Computing

The Commonsense Computing project originated at the MIT Media Lab and expanded
worldwide. Tens of thousands of contributors have taken some time to teach
facts to computers. Their pseudonyms can be found in the "sources" list found
attached to each statement, in ConceptNet's raw data and in its API.
